This file is under GNU GPL 3.0, you can use for any reason. If you want remove your IP, create or use a keybase account first. Mine is here - https://keybase.io/abhishekghosh

Then write a GitHub public gist referencing your real identity, sign with GPG and write the removal request with IP address. Then open a issue and request. 

When your IP is sending POST requests to `/xmlrpc.php`, you have to work to remove from this list. People will be using the list.
